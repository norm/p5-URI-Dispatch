URI::Dispatch 1.0
=================
URI::Dispatch is a dispatcher for handling URI paths, most commonly in a
web framework.

Includes functionality to add path handlers, determine which handler should
deal with a given path, automatically dispatch to that handler, and the
reverse -- construct a valid path given arguments.

It also doesn't use valid URI path characters for it's functionality, unlike
most others.
